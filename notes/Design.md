The design process is as follows:

# 1. Design our Algorithm in English (or any other language)

In this class, before we start ANY programming, we will write our steps in English.

# 2. Translate our Algorithm from English to Python

So that the program is a proper Python program.

# 3. Test our Python Algorithm

- Check if it works out syntactically (check to see if it breaks)
- Check if it works out semantically (check if our algorithm actually solves the problem)

# 4. Share our Work

Once the code solves the problem, ship your code to whoever uses it.
