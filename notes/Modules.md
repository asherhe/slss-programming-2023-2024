Modules are bits of code that we can use in Python.

These bits of code aren't automatically included, so we need to `import` them into our code.

# `import`

The `import` keyword loads the module into our file.

`import`s should be at the top of the file under the [[Header]]

# `time`

`time` allows us to manipulate time.

We can pause code using time:

```python
import time

# pause execution for 1s
time.sleep(1)
```
