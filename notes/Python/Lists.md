A list is a collection of items

# Creating a list

To make a list, we use brackets `[]` to surround our list.

We separate items with `,`:

```python
people = ["John", "Tim", "Sara"]
```

# Accessing list elements

We can grab things from a list using bracket notation.

For the previous example, we could do the following to access `"Tim"`:

```python
people[1] # "Tim"
```

Inside the brackets, we say the *index* of the value we want. Indices are 0-indexed.
