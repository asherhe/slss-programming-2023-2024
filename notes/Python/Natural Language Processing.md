# Output

We can use a function to display text and symbols to the screen.

We use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print("hello world")
```

# Input

We can grab information from the user using the `input()` function.

When we run it it does two things:

1. it waits for use to type something or nothing
2. the user presses enter/return to indicate that they are finished

# Variables

Variables allow us to store information for the time that our program is running

```python
a = 1
```

- `a`: variable name
- `=`: assignment operator
- `1`: value

> [!warning] Life lesson from Mr. Ubial
> Variable names should be as descriptive as possible
