# Popularity and Likes

This type of paradigm makes a suggestion based on how many people like the thing.

One prime example of this, is the like button (heart) in Instagram. When you click that heart, Instagram records it, and may suggest it to someone else similar to you based on that information.

We created the Favorite Bubble Tea servise which is based on the "Popularity/Likes" paradigm of recommendation systems.

N-point rating systems are used by many services but one that nearly everyone is familiar with is Amazon's main purchasing service.

This paradigm is where users rate a product out of a certain number.
